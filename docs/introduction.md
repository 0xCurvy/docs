# Introduction

Curvy is a privacy solution for secure, fast and compliant cryptocurrency payments.

We are a team of engineers, cryptographers and product designers who were driven to Web3 because of programmable fairness and neutrality.

But, without privacy, even systems that are designed as fair and neutral end up with a massive data theft problem.

We are immensely proud and humbled to be working on technology that can help establish privacy as a human right.

Our approach to building Curvy is to follow these four principles without compromise:

- **Privacy**: No party must under any circumstance be able to reconstruct your trail of transactions and your balance without your approval.
- **Compliance**: A well-known and credible party must be able to block malicious addresses or identities, both proactively and retroactively from using the payment protocol.
- **Utility**: The payment protocol must be as easy or easier to use than both competing Web3 Wallet products and Web2 payment solutions.
- **Self-custody**: Any interruption of any parts of Curvy excluding the underlying blockchain networks must not prevent, delay or partially limit access to user's funds.

Curvy software ecosystem consists of:

- **[Curvy App](https://app.curvy.box)** the non-custodial privacy interface developed and maintained by us, built on top of Curvy SDK.
- **[Curvy SDK](https://github.com/0xCurvy/sdk/)** complete open-source framework for building privacy enabled dApps and wallets
- **[Curvy Smart Contracts](https://github.com/0xCurvy/contracts)** on-chain contracts that facilitate private payments.
