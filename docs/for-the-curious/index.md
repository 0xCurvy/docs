# Curvy for the curious

This section explains Curvy's components and design choices in a technical manner.

To understand how Curvy works under the hood, we recommend first reading through the [In-depth walkthroughs](./walkthroughs/index.md).

As noted previously in the [Introduction](../introduction.md), Curvy's core principles are Privacy, Compliance, Utility, and Self-custody.

Then we will explain in detail how we adhere to these principles in [Building blocks](./building-blocks/index), and define exactly what we mean by [Privacy](./privacy-model.md) and [Compliance](./compliance-model.md).

> [!WARNING]
> **Privacy** and **Compliance** are words often used in spoken and written communication, where the audience and speaker almost always have wildly different definitions of the two. As this is a very careless and dangerous phenomenon, we dedicate entire sections of our docs to remove any ambiguity.
