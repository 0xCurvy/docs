# Curvy for the curious

This section aims to explain Curvy's components and design choices in a technical manner.

To get an understanding of how Curvy works under the hood, we recommend first reading through the [In-depth walkthroughs](./walkthroughs/index.md).

As we've noted previously in the [Introduction](../introduction.md), Curvy's core principles are Privacy, Compliance, Utility and Self-custody.

Then will try both to explain in detail how we stay true to these principles in [Building blocks](./building-blocks.md), and to define
exactly what we mean by [Privacy](./privacy-model.md) and [Compliance](./compliance-model.md).

> [!WARNING]
> **Privacy** and **Compliance** are words often thrown around in spoken and written communication with the audience and the speaker almost always having
wildly different definitions of the two - as this is a very careless and dangerous phenomenon we dedicate entire sections of our docs to remove any ambiguity.
