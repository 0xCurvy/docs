# Curvy for networks

> [!NOTE]
> If you are a blockchain ecosystem interested in partnering with Curvy, contact us at **<hey@curvy.box>**.

Curvy provides native privacy infrastructure that can be integrated at the network level, enabling private, compliant, and programmable payment flows for your ecosystem participants.

In addition to default support for your network through the Curvy SDK and Curvy App, we offer deeper integration models tailored to your strategic goals.

## Default Integration

Out of the box, Curvy supports:

- Private sending and receiving flows via the Curvy SDK  
- Network support within the Curvy App  
- Stealth address–based receiving  
- Privacy Aggregator support (where applicable)  

This allows your users, wallets, and applications to immediately benefit from privacy-enabled flows.

## Custom Network-Level Integrations

### White-label user domains

Launch your own ENS-style username namespace:

`satoshi.yourdomain.io`  
instead of  
`satoshi.curvy.name`

This allows your ecosystem to own the user-facing identity layer while leveraging Curvy’s underlying privacy infrastructure and customizing it to your needs.

### Full protocol customization

For ecosystems seeking deeper integration, Curvy can be customized at the infrastructure level:

- Control over transaction routing paths  
- Selection of integrated DeFi protocols  
- Definition of supported tokens  
- Ecosystem-level fee configuration  
- Subsidized privacy flows  
- Incentive mechanisms for adoption  

This enables networks to design privacy as a native feature rather than an external add-on.

## Partnership models

Curvy supports multiple collaboration models depending on ecosystem needs:

- SDK-level integration  
- Network-level identity layer  
- Privacy infrastructure embedded into wallets  
- Ecosystem-wide privacy incentives  
- Strategic co-development
